Project: zuul-bad
Authors: Victor Ortins (mainly), Pedro Lucena, Yan Feitosa, Pedro Augusto, Pedro Queiroga


This project is an extension of the zuul-bad project, created by Michael Kolling and David J. Barnes.

This project is a simple framework for an adventure game. In this version,
it has a lot of room, three floors, a lot of itens, such as weapons and food,
and a few monsters, ocasionally, like the one in the parking lot, mr dablo.

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.

A part of this application is based on the sugestions the book in which this
project is in, to better desing the classes and, in a near future, refactor the game.
